# Week 2

My questions
  Has wealth been improving over time or worsening? 
  Who are the countries and or regions that have enjoyed the greatest wealth improvements and why? 
  What can other countries do to better improve their wealth distributions? 
  Who are the poorest & wealthiest? Why are they in that position? 
  
I plan on sticking to the data and using proven economic models, so I will avoid including my own opinion.
